These are some rough notes on the S57 file format.  The existing documentation on this is either fairly sparse or incredibly complex.  
If you want to get in to the gory details then try to read the IHO documentation.  It is much more focused on how to generate the file
than it is on how to use it.   By far, I got more out of closely examing the code from the gdal and sharpmap distribution than I did
from reading all that stuff.

In brief, a S57 file consists of a number of layers.  Some of the layers have displayable and some do not.  The non-displayable layers
typically contain information about the map itself, while the displayable layers contain references to object.  It has to be noted that
the S57 file contains no directly displayable information.  It contains objects that must be translated into their appropriate display 
objects and color.  How to display the data in an S57 file requires the implementation of the S52 translation layer.  I have not got that
far yet.

The basic struction of each layer is exactly the same.  The first set of elements are the "Feature Definitions".  Each "Feature Defintion" has a name.

  This dataset tells us 
how to interpret the next layer.  For example, it contains data such as what data type each element, how many digits it contains, and what 
precision it has.
